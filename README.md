The Calcium Compiled Programming Language was build on C++, with an emphesis on the community. Our goal is to create a programming language that is community managed, starting with a basic compiler. Feel free to fork and make your own version of the calcium programming language. We use the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license, which grants you a lot of permissions, without conditions. If you are a designer, but you can't code, or you don't want to code, you can just go to discussions/ideas to give an idea, feel free to do it, we will most likely implement it!
